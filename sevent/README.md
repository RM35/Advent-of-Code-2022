# P1

Roughed out implementation didnt give the correct anser on test but did on input. Very untidy but that's just how it be.

I let it auto space and add to the grid but threw that out for a 4000 tall which would fit everything.

# P2

Should repeat the pattern eventually. 10091 right/left moves and 5 shapes. 50k to repeat given a flat floor every 50k.

there are 7^2 floors so 50 floor variations therefore 2.5 million permutations. This requires dynamic programming again.
