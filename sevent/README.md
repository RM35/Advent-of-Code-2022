# P1

Roughed out implementation didnt give the correct anser on test but did on input. Very untidy but that's just how it be.

I let it auto space and add to the grid but threw that out for a 4000 tall which would fit everything.

# P2

Should repeat the pattern eventually. 10091 right/left moves and 5 shapes. 50k to repeat given a flat floor every 50k.

there are many floor/stack variations permutations in 100s millions. This requires dynamic programming again, probably.


# 100MM stacks to see what the ratio of height to stacks does:
Ratio jumped around within the same rought 1000 or so during this check. Can't check
them all as we can't just verify a height given the rules? maybe. not sure.
