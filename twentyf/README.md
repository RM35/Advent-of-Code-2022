- Basically base 10 to base 5 conversion
- Converting from SNAFU to base 10 is easy enough
- Use python math combination function to print the first n numbers with 4? characters to see the pattern better.
- Observing the "encoded output" for patterns. The decimal to SNAFU approach was the correct approach where we check the remainder and handle the carry overs properly.
